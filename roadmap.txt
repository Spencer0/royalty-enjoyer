//ROADMAP: 

// engine class with while loop forever takes in input and updating state with ticks
// (ticks can initally be 120 / s)


// input class reading for players inputs every time in the game loop, 
// if there are updates it returns an object of all of them


// state class holding the games state in a map and opening functions to mutate it safley

// storage class to save the users progress every so often (10 seconds, write state to local storage)

// draw class with a refresh every 60 frames reading the state of rendering it
